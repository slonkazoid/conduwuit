	GetPdu {

		event_id: Box<EventId>,

		/// Argument for us to attempt to fetch the event from the

	/// - Gets all the room state events for the specified room.
	///
	/// This is functionally equivalent to `GET
	/// /_matrix/client/v3/rooms/{roomid}/state`, except the admin command does
	/// *not* check if the sender user is allowed to see state events. This is
	/// done because it's implied that server admins here have database access
	/// and can see/get room info themselves anyways if they were malicious
	/// admins.
	///
	/// Of course the check is still done on the actual client API.
	GetRoomState {

		room_id: Box<RoomId>,

	///   `/_matrix/federation/v1/version` endpoint and measures the latency it
	///   took for the server to respond

	/// - Forces device lists for all local and remote users to be updated (as
	///   having new keys available)
	ForceDeviceListUpdates,

	/// - Change tracing log level/filter on the fly
	///
	/// This accepts the same format as the `log` config option.

	///   m.room.create)
	FirstPduInRoom {
		/// The room ID
		room_id: Box<RoomId>,

	/// - Prints the latest ("last") PDU in the specified room (typically a
	///   message)
	LatestPduInRoom {
		/// The room ID
		room_id: Box<RoomId>,
	},

	/// - Forcefully replaces the room state of our local copy of the specified
	///   room, with the copy (auth chain and room state events) the specified
	///   remote server says.
	///
	/// A common desire for room deletion is to simply "reset" our copy of the
	/// room. While this admin command is not a replacement for that, if you
	/// know you have split/broken room state and you know another server in the
	/// room that has the best/working room state, this command can let you use
	/// their room state. Such example is your server saying users are in a
	/// room, but other servers are saying they're not in the room in question.
	///
	/// This command will get the latest PDU in the room we know about, and
	/// request the room state at that point in time via
	/// `/_matrix/federation/v1/state/{roomId}`.
